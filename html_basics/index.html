    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>I have been longing for MBCHB for my whole life to be exact,since grade 9 the drive to this was mainly because I believe that my grandmother died from a heart disease. I wanted to be a cardiologist so I can save people and minimise their suffering by all means.
        <h2>How did it go about</h2>
        <p>I was very discouraged when i gt rejected for mbchb at UKZN. I really had hope that I will be accepted but i guess the lord always has his ways,I am ver happy to say that Allah pulled through for me I got into medicine the following year all by the grace of Allah</p>
    </p>
    <aside><h3>My Lord</h3>
    <p>As a former christian I never felt fullfiled with christianity, somehow I got piece when I got closer to Allah.</p></aside>
